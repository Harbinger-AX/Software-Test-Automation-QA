How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Running regular code reviews, dependency checks, tests, and shakedowns is vital to ensuring that the product is stable and meets user requirements.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Developing a framework for turning user stories into actionable functions is part of the development process and involves diagramming, pseudocode, and trial-and-error testing.

How do I approach designing software?
There is no "one size fits all" approach to software development but experience and basic guidelines can help in starting out and it's always a good idea to start with a basic framework of desired features, basic functions, general behavior, and how the product would ideally look and feel to the user.
